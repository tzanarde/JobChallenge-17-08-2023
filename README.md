## Job Test

Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a
non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

### Example

For s = "abacabad", the output should be
solution(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
solution(s) = '_'.

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.

#### Another examples
'actcay' => 't'
'abcxabc' => 'x'
'zzywxx' => 'y'
